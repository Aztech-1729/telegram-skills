# Rust with teloxide

Use for Rust HTTP bots with teloxide. MTProto user-account clients require a separately selected library and account-specific workflow.

## Implement against the published crate

- Read [the Rust guide](references/guide.md) for feature flags, REPL versus Dispatcher, commands, dependency injection, dialogue storage, callbacks, media, errors, and webhook listeners.
- Read [the dated source record](references/sources.md) before relying on a recent Bot API field. Published teloxide 0.17.0 and the development branch have different coverage.
- Use Tokio-compatible async work; move blocking operations to bounded worker tasks. Do not hold synchronous locks across await points.
- Use one update receiver, explicit authorization, durable application state, and bounded retries. Request adaptors assist delivery; they do not make effects exactly once.
- Compile with the project's supported Rust toolchain and selected features. Test handler logic locally before starting a receiver or making Telegram calls.
- For API features absent from the pinned crate, choose a documented fallback or isolate a small official-HTTP request adapter. Do not invent a teloxide method or change the framework without explaining the compatibility decision.

## Starter

[assets/echo/Cargo.toml](assets/echo/Cargo.toml) and [src/main.rs](assets/echo/src/main.rs) provide a minimal text echo design. It reads TELOXIDE_TOKEN. The source record states whether compilation was available; source review alone is not a cargo check.

Use the feature guides for interaction design, Stars, Mini Apps, and operations when relevant, translating examples to Rust.
